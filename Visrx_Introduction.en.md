# VisRx Introduction

This is an introduction to VisRx in Markdown format. Two years after the original build, I’m putting this project onto a website to both document the OG days and showcase portfolio work. Text and media resources to reconstruct the website start here.

## Background

### Our Observations

1. Seniors face challenges taking medication, and helping them take it correctly is even harder. Declines in memory, execution, and comprehension make medication adherence difficult.
2. Relying on seniors alone to understand and take medicine accurately is unrealistic. Caregivers (children/family) lack effective tools to support and communicate around medication.

### Our Solutions

We streamline the workflow between seniors and caregivers to complete the “taking medicine” task end‑to‑end — an integrated solution for the medication scenario.

## VisRx

### Visuals

Because there are two roles, the app shows different interfaces for each user:

- Senior side: Accessible, ultra‑large typography. The home screen summarizes today’s plan and reads it aloud, with quick access to AR guidance.
- Caregiver side: Scan drug leaflets for automatic analysis and quick add; more detailed management views.

### Main Features

1. One‑tap medication import
   - Intelligent import: Use the camera for OCR, combine HealthKit basics, and leverage an LLM to parse drug leaflets — removing tedious manual entry.
2. AR‑assisted medication for seniors
   - A new accessible interaction. With SceneKit and ML, seniors can use hand gestures to interact with medicines and hear specific instructions.
3. AR guidance + LLM Q&A
   - Point at a medicine and ask questions to get immediate answers, making the medicine “come alive”.
4. Dual‑end login/binding with family sharing
   - Sync medications, reminders, and history. Caregivers can add medicines; seniors see updates immediately. Caregivers can review adherence history.
5. Summary
   - Key flows and UI summarized across both roles.

## Endnote

I led and developed VisRx (YaoYi), a mobile application that won 1st Prize (National Finals) at the 2023 China Collegiate Computing Contest – Mobile Application Innovation, co‑hosted by Zhejiang University and Apple.

As Team Captain, I managed a multidisciplinary team and delivered BUPT’s first‑ever national championship in this contest (2,800+ teams, 891 universities).

In early 2023 I implemented an ARKit‑based spatial perception system, pioneering the integration of ARKit with large language models to enhance spatial understanding. This effectively enabled LLMs to handle real‑world context even when GPT‑3.5 (with limited multimodal capabilities then) was the prevalent base model.

The project addresses healthcare and cognitive‑support scenarios, highlighting cross‑disciplinary innovation and real‑world applicability.

Thanks to my teammate @zhs852 for his effort and support — this wouldn’t have been possible without him.
